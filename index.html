                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I began my academic journey at The City School in Karachi, where I studied from Grade 1 all the way through A Levels. During these formative years, I cultivated a strong foundation in analytical thinking and problem-solving. I passed my O Levels in 2022 and A Levels in 2024, achieving top grades, including A's and A*'s. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity at FAST NUCES Karachi. To complement my academic studies, I am also enrolled in multiple Computer Science programs on Coursera, which deepens my understanding of real-world network security, risk mitigation, and digital defense strategies.</p>

                <h2>Interests</h2>
                <p>My interests span a mix of professional and personal pursuits. I’m deeply passionate about cybersecurity—understanding how systems are breached, how attacks are engineered, and most importantly, how they can be prevented. Ethical hacking, digital forensics, and penetration testing are areas that especially fascinate me. Coding is both a hobby and a skill I continuously sharpen through projects in Python and C++, and I often experiment with building tools or small web applications in my spare time. Outside of tech, I enjoy watching and playing cricket and soccer. I also love reading thriller novels, where intricate plots and psychological twists captivate me in the same way complex cybersecurity problems do.</p>

                <h2>Good Memory</h2>
                <p>One of my most cherished memories is receiving my O Level results in 2022. After months of focused effort, uncertainty, and pressure, the results confirmed that my hard work had paid off. That moment was more than academic—it was a turning point in my self-confidence. It reassured me that with dedication and proper planning, no goal is unreachable. That memory still motivates me, especially during challenging university semesters or when tackling complex coding problems. It reminds me that discipline and perseverance always yield results.</p>
